* still working on trying to get the evostat window to come up on the screen
- yesterday's issue was that Prolog wasn't installed (forgot I did it on subsystem, but not here)
- $ sudo apt-get install swi-prolog

Using commands sent to me via text by PR on 8/15 & 16/19
There are some weird things on a brand new installation that aren't automatic.

A) The evostat standalone program is created by consulting c.pl [c]. And then typing: save_evostat. Then: halt. You will need to do this before creating the symbolic link.

How to consult evostat
- do $ swipl c.pl while in ~/src/EvoStat to start program
- at ?- prompt, type: save_evostat. (remember the ".")A lot of stuff happens, ending with a returned value of "true."
- at ?- prompt, type: halt. (again, remember the ".") This exits Prolog.

B) Make a symbolic link in /usr/bin to the evostat program that is in the EvoStat directory. The program uses this link, via the standard utility 'readlink' to find the EvoStat directory whenever someone calls 'evostat' (/usr/bin is always on the searchpath).

How to make a symbolic link: $ ln -s source_file myfile
- go to /usr/bin
- source_file is in ~/src/EvoStat
- so: $ ln -s ~/src/EvoStat/evostat evostat

C) There needs to be a file named <hostname>.pl with the specific configuration details. You can start with a copy of aristotle.pl included in the github files. (this sound like a nice feature to add: if evostat appears to be running for the first time, copy aristotle.pl to <hostname>.pl and tell the user you are doing this. Also report such things as: there is no camera, ... 

In other words, the checklist needs to be in the program.
Consider that a bit of missing documentation.
I feel like I've subscribed to 'EvoStat Fact of the Day'. I just awoke to my new fact.

- to run it: $ ./evostat

D) needed to clone plblue repository, then install libblue-dev and bluez
Also, then run make & make install
	
	

Thanks for figuring out how to configure emacs to recognize prolog files, that was better than me "saving you the trouble"

I don't know how to branch in Git, but that is definitely the right thing to do. And then you can teach me about branches.  I don't think there will be any harm in this and is really the right way to do it!

Are you a full collaborator in eatoin5hrdlu/EvoStat ? I do want you to be able to check things in.  You can check in "amelia.pl" for instance, no need to branch (do this before branching) as this is a new file and I'd like to see it in my "branch" (whatever that means).

To add you as a collaborator, I need your GitHub id.  Just checked and dawn.trembath@gmail.com  does not have a github account.  Is there another email or different ID?

Just an fyi - what I'll be working on today:

1) get emacs to recognize .pl extension as Prolog
- so far, I have located instructions on swi-prolog site
- explored emacs directory structure to understand what needs to go where
- it should be working shortly, I hope

2) make a copy of huxley configuration file
- decide how I should be organizing repository for my EvoStat related contributions
- for example, I want to start keeping a log of tasks & fixes, in the same vein as this email. That would likely belong in my own repository
- however, what about my toy evostat (amelia, which I can eventually give a more serious name). Should I start a branch (eep), or does that also belong in my personal repository???

3) recreate the symbolic links, per your text of 8/16

4) use emacs (which now recognizes .pl extension correctly) to create amelia configuration file by analogy to huxley file

5) try to consult c.pl
- see if I can easily address issues that arise
- consult you if I cannot

6) add arduino & BT to the system ( I have one of the boards you gave me, so can begin to do that here, if needed)
